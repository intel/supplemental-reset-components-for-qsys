# This script is designed to take the qsys.tcl file exported from Qsys 16.0 for
# the complete Qsys system and modify it so we can reorder the add_instance
# commands so that the system displays in the Qsys GUI with the desired order.
#
# To create the qsys.tcl script, run qsys-edit version 16.0, open your existing
# Qsys system and choose File->"Export system as qsys script".
#
# Pass the name of the <qsys.tcl> file to be processed into this script, the
# name of the output file will be create_qsys_system_<qsys.tcl>.
